A gray dawn hangs low over a shattered battlefield, where churned mud clings to broken boots and the air smells of smoke, damp earth, and spent metal. Burned-out vehicles sit half-sunk in craters, their twisted frames silhouetted against a sky streaked with drifting ash. Barbed wire sags between splintered posts, rattling softly in the wind, while distant artillery thuds echo like a slow, relentless heartbeat beyond the hills. Figures move cautiously through the haze, helmets dulled with grime, eyes scanning the ruins of farmhouses and trees reduced to blackened stumps. Everything feels tense and exposed, as if the land itself is holding its breath, waiting for the next command, the next explosion, the next moment that will decide who advances and who does not.
